`biscale` implements a set of functions for bivariate themeatic mapping based on the [tutorial](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/) written by Timo Grossenbacher and Angelo Zehr as well as a set of bivariate mapping palettes from Joshua Stevens's [tutorial](http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/). 

## Installation
### Installing Dependencies
You should check the [`sf` package website](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for the latest details on installing dependencies for that package. Instructions vary significantly by operating system. Linux users in particular should also check the [`biscale` package repo](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/biscale/blob/master/.travis/install.sh) for a script that installs the relevant dependencies. For best results, have `sf` installed before you install `biscale`. Other dependencies, like `dplyr`, will be installed automatically with `areal` if they are not already present.

### Installing biscale
Once you have `sf` installed, you can install `biscale` with the `remotes` package:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/biscale")
```

## Usage
Creating bivariate plots in the style described by [Grossenbacher and Zehr](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/) requires a number of dependencies in addition to `biscale` - `ggplot2` for plotting, `cowplot` for combining the legend and the main map, and `sf` for working with spaital objects in `R`:

```r
# load dependencies
library(biscale)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(sf)
```

The `biscale` package comes with some sample data from St. Louis, MO that you can use to check out the bivariate mapping workflow:

```r
# load data
data <- stl_race_income
```

First, we want to create our classes. `biscale` currently supports a both two-by-two and three-by-three tables of classes, created with the `bi_class()` function:

```r
# create classes
data <- bi_class(data, x = pctWhite, y = medInc, dim = 3)
```

The default method for calculating breaks is `"quantile"`, which will provide breaks at 33.33% and 66.66% percent (i.e. tercile breaks) for three-by-three palettes. Other options are `"equal"`, `"fisher"`, and `"jenks"`. These are specified with the optional `style` argument. The `dim` argument is used to adjust whether a two-by-two and three-by-three tables of classes is returned

Once breaks are created, we can use `bi_scale_fill()` as part of our `ggplot()` call:

```r
# create map
map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = data, aes(fill = bi_class), color = "white", size = 0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +
  bi_scale_fill(pal = "DkBlue", dim = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Race and Income in St. Louis, MO",
    subtitle = "Dark Blue (DkBlue) Palette"
  ) +
  bi_theme()
```

Other options for palettes include `"Brown"`, `"DkCyan"`, `"DkViolet"`, and `"GrPink"`. The `bi_theme()` function applies a simple theme without distracting elements, which is preferable given the already elevated complexity of a bivarite map. We need to specify the dimensions of the palette for `bi_scale_fill()` as well.

To add a legend to our map, we need to create a second `ggplot` object. We can use `bi_legend()` to accomplish this, which allows us to easily specify the fill palette, the x and y axis labels, and their size along with the dimensions of the palette:

```r
legend <- bi_legend(pal = "DkBlue",
                    dim = 3,
                    xlab = "Higher % White ",
                    ylab = "Higher Income ",
                    size = 8)
```

Note that [`plotmath`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/grDevices/html/plotmath.html) is used to draw the arrows since Unicode arrows are font dependent. This happens internally as part of `bi_legend()` - you don't need to include them in your `xlab` and `ylab` arguments!

With our legend drawn, we can then combine the legend and the map with `cowplot`. The values needed for this stage will be subject to experimentation depending on the shape of the map itself.

```r
# combine map with legend
finalPlot <- ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(map, 0, 0, 1, 1) +
  draw_plot(legend, 0.2, .7, 0.2, 0.2)
```
