`biscale` implements a set of functions for bivariate thematic mapping based on the [tutorial](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/) written by Timo Grossenbacher and Angelo Zehr as well as a set of bivariate mapping palettes from Joshua Stevens's [tutorial](http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/). The package currently supports two-by-two and three-by-three bivariate maps:

```{r exampleMap, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/biscale.001.png")
```

In addition to support for both two-by-two and three-by-three maps, the package also supports four methods for calculating breaks for bivariate maps.

## What's New
`biscale` v0.1.2.9000 is underway! This will be a maintence release that includes typo corrections. It does add the ability to pass objects to `bi_legend()`'s x and y axis label arguments, which may be useful to some users. The `biscale` workflow has also been tested with the new [release candidate for `cowplot`](https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot) as well as the amazing `ggplot2` update and works as expected.

## Quick Start
If the `sf` package is already installed, the development version of `biscale` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
install.packages("biscale")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `biscale` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/biscale")
```

Additional details, including some tips for installing `sf`, can be found in the [Get started article](articles/biscale.html#getting-started).

## Resources
In addition to instructions for installation, the main [Get started](articles/biscale.html) article has:

  * a quick overview of bivariate mapping,
  * a description of the workflow for creating bivariate maps,
  * a comparison of different approaches to calculating those classes,
  * and a comparison of different color palettes for bivariate mapping.
