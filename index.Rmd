`biscale` implements a set of functions for bivariate thematic mapping based on the [tutorial](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/) written by Timo Grossenbacher and Angelo Zehr as well as a set of bivariate mapping palettes from Joshua Stevens's [tutorial](http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/). The package currently supports two-by-two and three-by-three bivariate maps:

```{r exampleMap, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/biscale.001.png")
```

In addition to support for both two-by-two and three-by-three maps, the package also supports four methods for calculating breaks for bivariate maps.

## What's New on CRAN?
### Dependency Change
In order to resolve a conflict between the `tibble` package and `biscale`, the `sf` package is now a required dependency as opposed to being a suggested dependency.

### Mapping Points
The development version contains a new function, `bi_scale_color()`, which replicates the bivariate mapping workflow for point and line data. We don't have any sample data for it yet, but the workflow mapping point data looks like this:

```r
# create classes
data <- bi_class(pointData, x = xvar, y = yvar, style = "quantile", dim = 3)

# create map
map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = pointData, mapping = aes(color = bi_class), show.legend = FALSE) +
  bi_scale_color(pal = "DkBlue", dim = 3) +
  bi_theme()
```

The creation of classes works the same way. The only difference is (a) the use of the `color` (or `colour`) argument in the aesthetic mapping for `geom_sf()` and the use of `bi_scale_color()` afterwards!

### Manual Palettes
If you want to use a different palette with `biscale` plots, you can use the new `bi_pal_manual()` function to create the plot and then apply it to `bi_scale_fill()` or `bi_scale_color()` using the `pal` argument.

```r
# create classes
data <- bi_class(pointData, x = xvar, y = yvar, style = "quantile", dim = 2)

# create custom palette
custom_pal <- bi_pal_manual(val_1_1 = "#E8E8E8", val_1_2 = "#73AE80", val_2_1 = "#6C83B5", val_2_2 = "#2A5A5B")

# create map
map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = pointData, mapping = aes(color = bi_class), show.legend = FALSE) +
  bi_scale_color(pal = custom_pal, dim = 3) +
  bi_theme()
```

## Quick Start
If the `sf` package is already installed, the development version of `biscale` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
install.packages("biscale")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `biscale` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/biscale")
```

Additional details, including some tips for installing `sf`, can be found in the [Get started article](articles/biscale.html#getting-started).

## Resources
In addition to instructions for installation, the main [Get started](articles/biscale.html) article has:

  * a quick overview of bivariate mapping,
  * a description of the workflow for creating bivariate maps,
  * a comparison of different approaches to calculating those classes,
  * and a comparison of different color palettes for bivariate mapping.
